# HMAC Server/Client Chat Application
====== Implementation and Application of HMAC Program =====

Function: Utilize HMAC and DES to create a simple client/server chat program. The program will display the encoded/decoded messages along with key, HMAC, verification and more.

Languages/Libraries: I used Java for the application. The libraries I used were primarily Java's socket, input/output stream, and crypto libraries.

IDE used: IntelliJ

How to Run: Run the Server application first and then run the Client one next. The console will let you know when you have established a connection and then the server and 
client should be able to take turns communicating with each other. The Server and Client files can be found in the src file.
